# 💼 Samrat Gharti's Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site is currently **under construction**, but feel free to look around as I build and improve this over time.

## 🚧 Current Status

The core structure has been set up, and I'm actively working on adding:
- Projects 
- Resume and downloadable PDF
- Blog 
- Contact form and social links
- Visual/UI improvements

## 🔧 Built With

- **HTML5** / **CSS3**  
- **JavaScript** (currently adding interactivity)
- [Future Plan] React (for dynamic content)
- [Future Plan] Hosting with GitHub Pages / Netlify

## 📁 Folder Structure (subject to change)

## Suggestions for myself

- The color scheme for the website is ugly. After the completion, change the color scheme.
